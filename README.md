Portfolio Project

# Overview of Project

This project was to make a responsive portfolio page to work on devices of multiple sizes. I used materialize, fontawesome and google fonts to help with a lot of the lay out of the pages. Just a few beginner projects added so far! Looking to add a lot more in the future!
